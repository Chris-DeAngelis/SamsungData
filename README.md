# SamsungData
## The R script will load the Samsung training data from your working directory to:
###	1. Merge the training and test sets into one data set.
###	2. Extract only the mean and standard deviation of each measurement.
###	3. Use descriptive names of the activities in each data set.
###	4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
###	5. Writes a tidyTable text file with the clean results (average of each variable for each activity and subject).
